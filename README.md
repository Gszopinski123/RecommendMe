Overview

This Project is a basic web application that uses a PHP, Mysql, Linux, apache(lamp) and uses basic web page development with html, css, and javascript

This project incorporates php, html, javascript, css on the frontend of the website and php,javascript,mysql interactions on the backend.

This project's main function is to allow users to show their letters of recommendation or other important documents and also to view other users' pages to see their important documents as well.

Inspiration

This web application is a Letter of Recommendation holder. My inspiration for this project was that I was always hesitant or felt that asking a professor for two letters of recommendation would be a little strange and that if I could hold them and keep them in one spot for potential recruiters, University's/academic places

Another key point of inspiration was learning how websites interact with databases and between languages such as the AJAX feature between PHP and javascript which is implemented in the search feature on the home.php file in the Home directory.

My main goal of this project was to have a basic understanding of web applications functionality and the main differences between Frontend development and Backend development.
